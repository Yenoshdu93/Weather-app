# Weather App
Checkout the live demo app [here](https://weather-app-ruddy-iota-81.vercel.app/)

This is a simple weather application built with React that allows users to search for the current weather conditions of a specific location.

## Features

- Users can enter the name of a city to retrieve its current weather data.
- Weather data includes temperature, description, feels like temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
- Error handling for when weather data is not available for a given city.

## Technologies Used

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Axios: A promise-based HTTP client for making requests to the OpenWeatherMap API.
- OpenWeatherMap API: Provides weather data for locations around the world.

## Challenges Faced

During the development of this project, I encountered several challenges:

1. **API Integration**: Integrating the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data posed some challenges, particularly in handling the asynchronous nature of API requests and managing the response data.

2. **Error Handling**: Implementing robust error handling was crucial, especially when dealing with scenarios where weather data is not available for a given city. Figuring out how to gracefully handle these situations without disrupting the user experience required careful consideration.

3. **UI/UX Design**: Designing an intuitive and user-friendly interface presented its own set of challenges. Balancing functionality with aesthetics and ensuring a smooth user experience was a continuous process of iteration and refinement.

4. **State Management**: Managing state in a React application, particularly when dealing with user input and asynchronous data fetching, required a solid understanding of React's state management principles and hooks like useState and useEffect.

5. **Testing and Debugging**: Testing and debugging the application to ensure its reliability and performance across different devices and browsers was a time-consuming process. Identifying and fixing bugs, as well as optimizing code for efficiency, were ongoing tasks throughout the development cycle.

Despite these challenges, overcoming them ultimately led to a more robust and polished final product.
